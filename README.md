Code Challenges
This repository contains solutions for three code challenges written in Python. Each challenge focuses on different programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.

Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
Problem Statement
Given a time in the 12-hour format (hh:mm am/pm), create a function that converts it into the 24-hour format (hhmm hrs).

Solution
The convert_to_24_hour_time function takes a time input in the 12-hour format and converts it into the 24-hour format. It splits the input into hours, minutes, and the period (am/pm), and then applies the necessary transformations based on the period.

Challenge 2: Two Numbers are Positive
Problem Statement
Write a function that takes three integers as input and returns True if exactly two out of the three numbers are positive; otherwise, it returns False.

Solution
The positive_checker function checks if exactly two out of the three provided integers are positive. It calculates the number of positive integers and compares it with the value 2 to determine if the condition is met.

Challenge 3: Consonant Value
Problem Statement
Create a function that takes a string as input and calculates the highest value of a substring containing only consonant characters. Each consonant has a corresponding value (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).

Solution
The highest_consonant_string function calculates the value of each substring composed of consonant characters, then returns the highest value among them.

How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the appropriate challenge directory.
Run the Python script corresponding to the challenge (e.g., challenge1.py for Challenge 1).
Follow the prompt to input the required data.
The script will display the output based on the input provided.
Feel free to explore the code for each challenge, modify it as needed, and experiment with different inputs.

Note
These solutions were developed as part of a coding exercise and may not cover all edge cases. They serve as examples of how to approach the given problems and may require further testing and refinement for production use.
